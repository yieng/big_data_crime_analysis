You should read up on your own country and your contributions to global finance:   \"London is heart of global financial corruption\"  https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/29/roberto-saviano-london-is-heart-of-global-financial-corruption  London is now the global money-laundering centre for the drug trade, says crime expert http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/london-is-now-the-global-money-laundering-centre-for-the-drug-trade-says-crime-expert-10366262.html  Dark money: London\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dirty secret http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/1d805534-1185-11e6-839f-2922947098f0.html  UK Tax Havens: Jersey (United Kingdom) Isle of Man (United Kingdom) British Overseas Territories     Bermuda     British Virgin Islands     Cayman Islands\'[2016-08-30 12:16:21] \n\tOK, so I spent my first 20 years in East Anglia (bit I\'m not inbred, honest, my parents are not from there). Then 10 years in the West Midlands, 20 years in London and now 3 years in Yorkshire.  I think these things are largely banter and myths which have a grain of truth.  People are friendly everywhere, but they are much more friendly when they have time to be so.  London is much more multicultural and mixed-up than anywhere else.  Economically speaking, London and the SE DOES have a disproportionate amount of the nation\'s wealth, but let\'s not forget the City provides over 10% of the nation\'s tax take and is also full of foreign companies, so how could it be otherwise? In every region of the UK there are richer and poorer parts, winners and losers.  The biggest thing I notice is actually this- the further north you go, the bigger the variation in the length of the day / night- I mean daylight v darkness. I am 200 miles north of London, and the summer day is significantly longer, the winter day significantly shorter than in London. So I notice that everyone around me does make some effort to use the daylight- never noticed that in London.  I would say that yes, CULTURAL attitudes are more progressive in London. My girlfriend is from the town we now live in (but has become cosmpolitanised by education and work and has also lived abroad). When we moved (in her case back), she told me I had to behave more like what she saw as a traditional Yorkshire man (=be decisive and in charge) and us as a traditional Northern couple (woman is boss, tells man off incessantly). Indeed it\'s true that all we ever hear over the garden fences is women telling their menfolk off and the men meekly obeying. Aaaaagh![2016-08-08 09:38:53]\n\t&gt; What are the other weapons\' main usage for?  The default main guns on MBTs are known as HEAT weapons - High Explosive/Anti Tank.  Basically the middle ground of the three weapons - moderate direct damage and moderate splash.  It\'s generally suggested that if your aim is good, choosing the AP weapon will give you the greatest reward - it has the highest direct hit damage but almost zero splash effect.  If you want to farm groups of infantry, use the HE cannon because it has the largest splash radius.  &gt; Lightning tank:  Cannons:  The default Viper is actually a six-shot HEAT cannon.  It\'s powerful in its own right and can mow down smaller vehicles and groups of infantry quickly.  I wouldn\'t recommend using the Lighting HE or single-shot HEAT in its place.  The Lightning AP is good, although not as powerful as an MBT and it has slower velocity.  Utility slot:  Smoke is basically worthless because ground lockon launchers are rare.  Fire Suppression is the most useful - getting your vehicle out of the red can help you escape and not lose your vehicle.  Engagement radar is nice when paired with the Skyguard turret.  Defense Slot:  Stealth is all-around the most useful - when maxed out you won\'t auto-spot on enemies\' maps, won\'t stay spotted as long when Q-spotted, and it takes lockons a lot longer to get a lock.  Nanite Auto Repair is OK if you don\'t want to drive around as an engineer.  Mine Guard can be a boon because Lightnings are pretty quick and sometimes it\'s hard to see/react to enemy mines.  Prox Radar is kind of silly because you should be switching to 3rd-person cam periodically to check your surroundings anyway.  Out of the armors, only Top is sort of useful, and even then only if you are planning on hunting Liberators.  Performance:  Personal preference.  I like racer because going fast is awesome.  &gt; Main Battle Tanks  Utility Slot:  Basically you are choosing between your faction ability, or Fire Suppression.  Anchored Mode is pretty situational, but very powerful if you are in a good position to rain down the shells.  An Anchored Prowler with the AP cannon can melt a deployed sunderer in literally seconds.  Vanguard Shield is basically always useful, but be careful not to take too many risks while it\'s on cooldown because the Vanguard is very slow.  Magburner (speed boost and increased hover height) is neat and can allow the Magrider to reach some incredible places.  Defence and Performance slots are the same as Lightnings, so the same rules apply.  I can\'t speak on air vehicles as I have no experience with them.[2016-09-21 17:08:13]\n\tI am no expert but here are a few key points about this that I would have done differently or think I did properly.  1. Immediately put the claim on your own insurance if it\\\'s a bad accident that you think is totaled and get it towed to a dealership. They will quote much higher and give you a paper trail for proof that it\\\'s worth that higher amount.  2. Don\\\'t ever accept the first valuation, let them bump it up by a couple hundred first.  3. Check everything, the office I work with is SLOPPY they got my claim number wrong multiple times, date and time of accident wrong twice now. Hell, as you read in my story they even got the model and option package wrong for 3 weeks I had to fight this. If you finance another vehicle from a dealership like I did make nice with your dealer as they can pull records and stuff for you that make dealing with the insurance easier (I had to pull invoices for the MSRP of my vehicle and one they claimed was higher end using VIN before they believed me and my dealer did that)  3. This is kind of a point 2.a, their valuation sometimes has outright inaccurate information with projected sales price adjustments. I get it dealerships charge more but they could easily find this information out but they don\\\'t because they want to pay less. If you correct this information by calling dealerships and getting the actual sales price of the vehicles that usually gets it up by a couple hundred.  4. I asked for the grading rubric they used to claim my car had almost $500 in damages inside my vehicle, over a week now and still haven\\\'t received it even with daily emails. I dunno if this is the thing to do but I know they are overestimating my damages as I am the type of person who takes care of his car quite well I\\\'d say.   5. If this happened at your property don\\\'t be nice and claim no property damage for turned up grass. They won\\\'t be nice to you so don\\\'t be nice back. Despite \"good-faith\" the agents I deal with even from the beginning where more like used care salesmen than they were an advocate for me trying to get me to settle for much less than I am owed. This comes down to ANYTHING that could be damaged from the accident, don\\\'t pull any punches just lay it all out there.  I hope that helps though it\\\'s pretty basic... I\\\'d say I haven\\\'t accomplished much in my own claim lol though I really wish I would have towed it myself through my insurance to my dealership to get it evaluated damages and total value of vehicle as I would have had more argument room at this point.\'[2016-09-21 17:14:08]\n\tNot to mention only firing quadrant based resist profile, instead of impact location based.  I\'d also like to see semi-realistic damage based on where the vehicle is hit, such as thrown tracks, damaged turrets or cameras (HUDs), along with maybe even a small chance to hit the vehicles magazine.[2016-09-21 17:00:33]\n\tYou can reusably fling them. The one advantage is that you can crew a vehicle (it doesn\'t tap to fling), then either swing and toss it, or if it gets declarationed toss it in response. It\'s certainly janky by eternal standards but if standard gets slow, especially after stuff like advocate rotates out you have vehicles that can swing for a huge amount of damage, and removal isn\'t so fluid right now that it simply folds to a bolt. I dont know if kaladesh was enough to give the Rg energy zoo enough legs to be good enough to make standard less than a 5-6 turn format, yet.[2016-09-21 16:45:45]";

Even that is irrelevant. Ireland\'s gun laws don\'t stop criminals from obtaining firearms when the price is right.  &gt; There simply aren\'t very many guns in the country.  As of 2008, there were [233k](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/cp/ireland). In a country of 5 million that\'s not an insignificant number. Despite this, crime and other homicide involving firearms is miniscule, and not carried out by people who legally license them.  &gt; They\'re difficult to obtain, risky to shop for and (most importantly) expensive.  Exactly. This only hurts people who would safely operate and own firearms. I don\'t see a reason to penalise responsible adults.  &gt; You\'ve to spend a lot of money and use criminal connections to get any sort of automatic weapon in Ireland.  I don\'t see a reason for the fixation with automatic weapons. They\'re tactically useless (except if spray and pray is your tactic).  &gt; The lad mugging you in a laneway isn\'t whipping out a revolver.  But he more than likely will have a knife. And a knife is a lethal weapon. Can the guards prevent it?  And that brings up a very important point: it is illegal to carry a knife of any kind anywhere without having a \'good reason\' to do it. Does this law stop knife crime? Moreover, did the removal of gun rights increase or decrease the amount of crime arising from knives? It increased it.   &gt; Reducing controls on guns increases the number of guns, and their availability.  This is a bad thing--because it reduces the availability of guns for people who could operate them safely. Not for criminals. In order for such a law to be a good thing, it would have to prevent criminals from getting them, which it doesn\'t.  And it makes people helpless in the face of violence. Look at the Bataclan. Now thank jaysus we haven\'t had incidents of this nature spill over to here. But all those people were helpless--running, hiding, trying to get away, and were totally defenseless. Imagine someone there had a properly licensed firearm (and concealed carry was legal) and could return fire. Would it have made a difference? Absolutely.  We all know that relying on Garda to protect us is an errant idea. They\'re not adequately equipped. They\'re response time is going to be slow (even if they\'re near). Certainly not fast enough to prevent someone from harming you if they mean to do it. So the question is really \'are you prepared to be a victim\' for the greater good of society?  &gt; but they become targets themselves for the theft of firearms, and generally make it easier to get guns in Ireland, which escalates any home invasion situation.  Three points: A) It\'s hard to steal a gun that is properly secured; B) having a nice car makes it more likely to be stolen, but we don\'t ban nice cars; C) there is a continuum of force, and escalating to the highest level immediately isn\'t always the case. Moreover, if someone represents a lethal threat to you or your loved ones, use of lethal force is required and justified.   We should not cry crocodile tears for people who are trying to kill us. The easiest solution to prevent injury in a home invasion is to not invade homes in the first place. If you think the person on the inside is armed, maybe you think twice about it. [2016-09-19 10:11:34] \n\tYes, but what does the female who fires this do when the prongs are ripped out and the much, much larger male charges her? Yes, it was the female who fired the firearm.. and a male who fired the tazer. The female was first to interact with this individual. The female had him at gunpoint before the other 3 arrived on scene. She had him at gunpoint because he appeared out of nowhere (she was looking in the vehicle to see if there was anyone inside the stalled vehicle). When she saw him, she gave him numerous commands, which he ignored - all of which were commands that would\'ve ended with him on the ground so he couldn\'t charge her. With the full context, I think her actions prior to the shot being fired were 100% justifiable. I\'ll wait for better footage (hoping to see where his hands were going) to say whether or not the shot fired was justifiable.  Edit: If his hand did breach the window, the shot was justifiable.[2016-09-20 05:53:28]\n\tOk, so I could be wrong here, but we really need to see body cam footage if there is any.  From the helicopter footage, I can\'t actually tell if he is reaching in to his vehicle or not.  If you look at the police squad car dash cams, it looks like he\'s trying to get his keys or something out of his pocket, and you hear a single shot from a firearm (and can see a small cloud of exploding gunpowder).  The man then slumps against the door of his car, then a few seconds later he falls to the ground...I\'m assuming him falling down is when he was tased.    He was clearly shot first.[2016-09-20 06:11:35]\n\tThere are two definitions of arrest for police encounters:  Most people think arrest means being hauled off to jail and being possibly charged with a crime (though being charged is not a requirement).   However, if a police officer pulls over your vehicle or tells you to hold on for a moment while you are walking on a sidewalk; in both cases the officer is impeding or *arresting* your progress.   This is the arrest to which *Resisting Arrest* refers.   You are legally obligated to stop all movement if an officer arrests or detains you; *even* if the officer has no probable cause to do so (of course the legal defintions of PC are so ambiguous that it could be its own separate discussion).   Many would view a stop without cause as unconstitutional (specifics and legal precedents aside) and as such often (but not always) result in no criminal charges.   And of course, many stops with or without probable cause, result in no finding of criminal activity.   This is the kicker though:  If you attempt to impede an officer\'s attempts to impede your progress, regardless of the existence of criminal activity or probable cause, you are still violating your legal obligation to stop for the officer, even if that stop was unconstitutional.   That\'s why you can be arrested for resisting arrest without a single other charge or suspicion.   Good grief.  EDIT: Grammer. Also IANAL.[2016-08-05 23:39:12]\n\t&gt; A small minority do.  [Ireland](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/crime/republic-of-ireland-is-deadliest-place-to-live-in-irish-and-british-isles-new-figures-34614775.html) is the \'deadliest place in the British Isles\' (sic).

If you think the person on the inside is armed, maybe you think twice about it.[2016-09-19 10:11:34]\n\t&gt; As a rule, practically every gun in criminal circulation has been stolen.  Not sure how you know this considering the Gardai themselves don\'t know it.  See [here](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/2014.WG.Report.pdf/Files/2014.WG.Report.pdf), from the Executive Summary of the Garda report that led to a public consulation:  &gt; An Garda S\\xc3\\xadoch\\xc3\\xa1na have also advised that between 2009 and 2013 there were 96 murders and one case of manslaughter recorded in which firearms were used. *In many such cases it is impossible to say (due to the fact that the firearm is often not recovered) whether the firearms used were firearms that had been licensed and subsequently stolen from their owners or whether the firearms were never in fact licensed.*  (emphasis mine)  &gt; Introduce more weapons into legal ownership, and you create more stolen guns in criminal circulation.  Conjecture, as above.   &gt; A clean weapon will cost several grand, that your average burglar scrote doesn\'t have.  Conjecture. Likewise, regular law abiding Joe might not have the money to buy a properly licensed firearm either, considering the 80\\xe2\\x82\\xac for the permit, weapon price, ammo price, cost of gunsafe, etc.   If the price is right for either, the law is no deterrent to get firearms.  &gt; Filling rural homes with weapons won\'t deter robberies,  Leaving aside the conjecture about theft, at least firearms protect them from the threat to injury and life that they experience, considering Gardai can\'t protect them. If the State can\'t guarantee people safety, then they have a right to do it themselves.[2016-09-19 11:18:25]\n\tWhat about the other comment was escalation? I just have a different view.   But, since you\\\'re sensitive to substantive reply, I\\\'ll make it shorter and only address things that are your major points.  &gt; There\\\'s a dozen reasons a farmer might need a single-barreled break-action shotgun on a farm without wanting to kill people  Almost no people with guns have a desire to kill people. That\\\'s an unfair characterisation of gun owners.  &gt; I think if they were \\\'tactically useless\\\' they wouldn\\\'t exist.  Automatic firearms are pointless. Most countries\\\' actual militaries have figured this out. Actual automatic weapons shoot one bullet at the target, and the rest at the ceiling/sky. (EDIT: I should specify I\\\'m talking about personal rifles)  People who want to ban auto weapons only are people who don\\\'t understand firearms. A shot on target is worth more than any number of them off target.   &gt; Them being illegal absolutely 100% reduces their availability for criminals.  Clearly untrue. Regency Hotel itself proves that wrong.  &gt; Then that person would be statistically hugely more likely to kill themselves or a family member with it  And statistically far more likely to be killed riding in the car driven by ones parents than to be killed by a firearm owned by ones parents.   &gt; would you rather be less likely to be a victim of violent crime in the first place, and have to deal with it by running away/fighting/knocking the shite out of some lad with an aul schtick, like our forefathers did\"  Just because you have a gun doesn\\\'t mean you have to use it, draw it, or even let your attacker know you have it. Continuum of force applies to every confrontation, whether you have a gun or not.  &gt; As much as you wanna be a keyboard kommando and imagine yourself tactical-rolling to your tactical shotgun  Stick to real arguments. You have absolutely no idea who I am. For all you know, I might have carried a firearm for a job, have seen real combat, and have first hand knowledge of what I am talking about.  &gt; guns lead to escalation, death, and greater levels of gun crime. Beatings become fatalities.  The culture of a place is what leads to fatalities, whether it\\\'s a gun, a knife, or a pipe. There are reasonable examples of countries where guns are owned safely in large numbers (as a % of the population) that aren\\\'t the Wild Wild West.  I don\\\'t think you have any familiarity with firearms, or the rights and responsibilities (especially responsibilities) of ownership. I also don\\\'t think you have any thought or plan for what you would do in a situation in which your life, or the lives of those around you, were in danger. \'[2016-09-19 11:47:18]\n\t&gt; Gun deaths in El Salvador are about 3x higher than road deaths there.  El Salvador is a little bit of a non-standard situation, don\'t you think?  &gt; but almost all of the 10,000+ gun deaths are intentional homicide whereas all but a tiny number of road deaths are accidental.  That\'s irrelevant. We\'re not talking about motives here--we\'re talking about outcomes.  Dead is still dead, even where a little old lady says \'oops, I just didn\'t see that cyclist.\' An \'accident\' is simply a misnomer for poor and unsafe operation.  &gt; The sole purpose and outcome of using a gun (apart from activities which are legal here, like hunting and sport) is massive bodily trauma.   The purpose of using a gun for hunting is to kill. I don\'t see why it should be an exception.  One of the four fundamental rules of firearm safety is \'never point a gun at something you do not intend to shoot.\' Responsible ownership implies observing this rule and determining within a spectrum of application of force when it is necessary (and not) to point this weapon at another human being.   People take it very seriously--much more seriously than they take the operation of automobiles.  &gt; Cars are not designed to be weapons, and are very, very rarely used as such.  Irrelevant.  &gt; this only shows that cars should be regulated even more than they have been to reduce road traffic deaths, but that\'s hardly an argument in favour of guns.  We can\'t regulate everything to perfect safety. Life is unsafe, and there are dangerous things. We must accept this.   Nobody is seriously advocating the banning of cars on safety grounds (environmental grounds are different). Which makes the argument a little absurd.  &gt; Why should I and everyone else in the country be exposed to a much greater risk of violence and crime just for your peace of mind and the vanishingly tiny chance, verging on statistical anomaly, of you preventing a crime?  You aren\'t at greater risk due to gun ownership. There are 230k+ gun owners in Ireland, and less than 50 gun deaths (and those from criminals almost exclusively). Pistols are *legal* in NI, and yet the Republic is a more dangerous place.   Do you think criminals buy firearms and legally license them?   When you say people are \'exposed to a much greater risk\' by gun owners, you\'re also saying that you wouldn\'t mind being defenseless in the face of a lethal threat to your well-being.   Let me give you two situations, and you tell me which you\'d prefer:  Someone opens fire in a public place--say a hotel in Dublin--and you:  1) hide with the guy next to you, both of you defenseless, hoping the guy with the gun doesn\'t see you.  2) guy next to you has a properly licensed firearm and returns fire, killing the shooter and saving the lives of you and others around you  Personally, I\'d prefer the second one.   But what it all comes down to is philosophy of life. Either you think the world is basically safe, and are then prepared to be a victim in the unlikely event of something unsafe happening, or you think life is unsafe inherently, you accept this, and you look for ways that you can make your own life safer.[2016-09-19 10:33:46]";

You\'re condemning a whole group based on the actions of a few.   Do you actively take offense to the messages and actions of the kkk, skinheads, racist militia groups, neo nazis etc?  Have you been pushing to label them as terrorist groups considering they actually have committed many acts of terrorism? To be clear the message of Blm is Blm too, not hate or division.    Ignorance can be found within every color, but making sweeping generalizations is one of the many problems associated with racism.   Whatever the medium, whatever state you enter you can find people with white complexions engaging in various types of criminal, drug related, or just ignorant behavior in general.  What is rare though is anyone attributing these acts as being a defining characteristic of white people as a whole.    I think one of the saddest things is to teach a child hatred. It\'s an emotion that ultimately not only serves as a burden to the one who carries it, but impedes progress of the human race.   As a child I was taught awareness of racism literally as a safety measure and to be prepared for the world I would encounter, but never taught hatred.  Most of the fights I had growing up were a result of racial epithets being thrown in my direction while minding my own business.  Still, despite many horror stories and experiences that long precede social media and camera phones every person I meet is viewed as an individual.      Just because someone has chosen to limit their exposure to different types of people doesn\'t mean there aren\'t vast amounts living outside of narrow stereotypes.  My parents are both well educated professionals who have friends of all backgrounds.  The majority of my family and their friends fit into the same category.  Sometimes people who are raised with hatred and insecurity will focus only on negativity and choose to ignore or discredit people of color who are clearly doing well and living in a way which doesn\'t lend itself to to their feelings of superiority.    I can tell you from a life of experience that racial profiling and harassment by police is very real.  In all fairness I will say that yes I have come across decent cops, but that doesn\'t negate all the times I was pulled over and harassed while doing absolutely nothing wrong.  Minorities have long been aware of the potential dangers of encounters with police, that\'s nothing new, social media and camera phones are new.   I have no criminal record and yet way to much experience with police. [2016-08-19 03:10:33]\n\tYou do realize those he is complaining about are doing the exact same thing? Talking about how the criminal justice system treats drug offences or other crimes. That isn\\\'t the topic here, not even remotely.   You complain \"people are allowed to have differing opinions about criminal justice.\" And Socialismnevertookro is allowed to have his own as well calling criticizing those opinions.   This isn\\\'t your safe space either. If after hearing a man is getting 18 years for raping 16 people the first reaction is to whine about how the justice system should be about reform we have differnt views on the situation. I mean really? Your big issue here is a serial rapists isn\\\'t being reformed right away? Not that fact he only got 18 years for **16 victim?** You are allowed to have differing opinions but I will stay on the side that says he should be in jail for **much** longer. Sorry, but he used up all his second chances and has repeatedly shown himself to be a danger to society. You will have to forgive me if i believe keeping him off the streets comes before reform in the case of a serial rapist. \'[2016-08-19 03:14:44]\n\tSo there aren\\\'t thieves in rural areas?  Didn\\\'t say or suggest that.  &gt;Gun ownership is fine as long as you aren\\\'t living in a bad area basically, okay  Didn\\\'t say or suggest that.  &gt;So we should dictate what people are allowed to do and own based solely on the actions of criminals?  Solely? No. Didn\\\'t say or suggest that.  &gt;Should we ban cars because some people commit vehicular manslaughter?  Didn\\\'t say or suggest that and it is not an equivalent comparison. Guns are a tool used for kill and aren\\\'t very good for anything else. Banning guns would not cause any significant detriment to society. It is more like saying \"You want to ban ricin just because it can be used to poison people?\" OF COURSE!  We shouldn\\\'t ban all murder weapons, nobody is suggesting that or anything similar. We should ban hand guns.  &gt;A gun being stolen doesn\\\'t necessarily mean there was a confrontation, the house could have been broken into while the owner of the firearm was away, someone they know could have taken it while they weren\\\'t looking, etc. Most of that would be fixed with proper firearm storage, which I agree is lax in most homes.  k  &gt;What would your solution to the problem be?    Ban handguns. A shotgun is as good as anything in the case of a home invasion. Handgun are easy to conceal, easy to use, and brutally deadly. Sure you might get mugged and have to hand over your wallet (if you live in gotham city.) But at least your mugger won\\\'t have a handgun.\'[2016-09-07 01:20:06]\n\t&gt; First, lets address the \'but the children!!!\' argument. A child dying is not dramatically different than anyone dying, its just that it creates an emotional response - its an emotionally laced fallacy. Second, the legality of the firearm isn\'t the issue, because the criminals are not using them legally. Banning them isn\'t going to inherently stop them from being able to shoot others - at best it will make it harder for them to get their hands on a gun, and that\'s still a tenuous argument in its own right. Third, what does it matter if children are killed by a legal firearm? Would it be less impactful if they were killed by illegal firearms? Bombs? Knives? Pencils? Box cutters?  This is exactly it. Just like locks only keep honest people honest, banning weapons only keep people who would otherwise go through legal channels to acquire a semi-automatic rifle. Criminals, or people who care little about regulations, and laws are not going to get their weapons legally. [2016-09-07 00:32:26]";

[2016-08-21 20:30:50]\n\tYou can visit the London Met Police website for crime statistics. Note that it is incredibly dishonest to conflate \"UK\" with \"London\" since the Air China mention was very specific since it\\\'s a travel guide for the city, and was very specific to direct tourists away from specific *neighbourhoods* not *people*. If white people's neighbourhoods are constantly being broken into then those *neighbourhoods* are going to be dangerous to live in. If Japanese people\\\'s *neighbourhoods* are hotbeds for mugging, then those *neighbourhoods* are dangerous to walk in. This *does not mean* that the whites and japanese respectively are the perpetrators of the crimes.  You need to really understand these statistics in order to interpret them in this context. As a tourist, I don't care about vehicle thefts or home intrusions. I care about public disorder, being assaulted or mugged in the streets. Relevant crime statistics for these *specific crimes* must be correlated against neighbourhoods in order to arrive at a determination as to whether or not the statement is factually accurate. Here is some data which further classifies the crimes themselves on the basis of neighbourhoods: http://illustreets.co.uk/blog/maps-and-apps/england-crime-map-annual-crime-rates/  Edit: Lastly it is a fucking travel magazine. When you read it as an educated person, you are supposed to assume that the conclusions drawn represent what the author observed during their research. This is not to be taken as the gospel truth about the universe.\'[2016-09-09 07:58:07] \n\tPerhaps for something as complex as gun laws in the US, \"quick research\" isn\\\'t enough to get the whole picture.  I\\\'d be curious to know what exactly you googled to come to that conclusion, but as someone that actually spends a lot of time looking into these things I\\\'m happy to give you a couple breakdowns:  - Especially with a recent law change, all semi-autos with parts that can be put on an \"assault weapon\", something that *isn\\\'t* banned in England by the way, is an assault weapon.  This is a change from the federal AWB and is in fact more restrictive than England in that it ends up as a ban of all semi-auto rifles, even rimfire guns which are fully legal in England.  - While handguns are legal in MA where they generally aren\\\'t in England (but are in N Ireland and your other \"western, developed\" countries), licenses are \"may issue\" meaning if the Chief of Police doesn\\\'t like you because... say... you\\\'re black, you\\\'re out of luck.  In England they\\\'re also may issue in terms of , but because of the difference of culture becomes a much less restrictive situation than we have here.  - Beyond assault weapons not being banned in England but being banned in MA, we\\\'re also completely not allowed to have suppressors, something not only allowed but often encouraged depending on where you are in England.  Go ahead and give me a lmgtfy.com link of what you searched that led you to that conclusion if you\\\'d like, but I guarantee your quick research covers a lot less than you think it does.  So again, if you want gun laws in line with other countries, will you fight for the removal of the assault weapon ban or...\'[2016-08-23 22:30:09]\n\tAwawawah already answered the question but I just wanted to add that the advice you saw applies to every weapon except a GW Gun that is going to be used with Gunslinger, for exactly the reason you mentioned (the bullet slots increase at max upgrade). For other weapons you\'ll get minimal stat/ougi increases that don\'t really justify the material cost. [2016-08-23 23:07:14]\n\tI\'m a former lawyer and understand the basics of the issue, but I\'m far from an expert.  You are right about the punishment daily and the endlessness of it all, for the victim\'s families as well.  The main issue for me is executing innocent people, which is completely unacceptable.  In cases like the Cheshire killings, the death penalty, in my opinion, is the humane thing for both for the community, the victims, as well as the guilty.  I feel for Dr. Petit and other survivors who get dragged back into court for this over and over again.  If there is no doubt about a crime of this magnitude, the only argument left is simply opposition to the death penalty.  The general trend is abolition, but I feel in cases without any doubt the death penalty is useful to purge evil people and give closure and finality to a criminal act that causes significant suffering. [2016-09-08 02:00:22] \n\tThis is one of the main things I think people have a problem with, and I will grant on this position a level of rebuttal can be made on the basis of ones own agency, but when you have classes structured in this way, especially for incoming first year students, and the perception towards University as a method of higher education, it\'s not so unwise to believe that your professor is an authority on any given subject that they teach, therefore, because of the perceived authority on the subject, students tend to believe these ideas, some people calling it indoctrination, I tend not to go this far, though it\'s not too far off.  My main fear is that my experience is the minority, that unlike myself, others may not as actively question the concepts that are being dictated to them, and will instead take them on board as fact as a process similar to religious faith, though in this case the values are for equality, equality of outcome in some situations mind you, which is essentially only brought to reality through communism, as opposed to equality of opportunity, which we may not be quite at, but are getting closer as time goes on.  This being said, I also fear that said progress is being lost, because of the actions similar to those that have just gone down in Milwaukee last night, citizens taking such violent actions in protest of a black criminal with a stolen firearm being shot by a black officer, leading to the burning of buildings, cars and gas stations, as well as the battery of multiple white people (Which were actual hate crimes), chants like \'Kill white people\' and \'Black power!\' constantly being repeated, because of the race separation rhetoric that has been consistently repeated by this regressive left by both individuals and the media, the failure to address this situation as anything other than riots is proof enough of this, I feel.[2016-08-16 03:41:08]";

It is less race and more poverty at this point. You see people of all flavors commit crimes in poor areas less so than in the middle class (and up) areas. Black men commit disproportionally more crime than any other group. A good way to start is to halt said crime. Being from Chicago, I know all of this first hand. Our crime, especially our notorious shootings, happens mostly in poor areas, though it is now leaking to more middle class areas in forms of armed robberies. Maybe it is easier said than done, but if you want to stop prejudice, then stop attacks on others. If we see that most of crime is committed by people in yellow shirts, then chances are that when we encounter a person with a yellow shirt, we will think twice. [2016-09-09 20:23:19]\n\tSo, what the media has been saying is NOT true?  Detroit is not a crime ridden city?  Next thing you know you\'ll be saying the same thing about Chicago...[2016-09-09 20:34:08]\n\tITT... people that \"grew up in the area 20 years ago saying it was safe then so it\\\'s safe now. \"  The problem is we don\\\'t know you. Are you 6\\\'5\" built like a house with a concealed carry license you use almost as much as your black belt?  Then you\\\'ll be fine. Are you coming with a group of 10 other 20-something reasonably tough males?  You\\\'ll be fine.   However, it sounds like you are coming alone, and I\\\'m going to assume you aren\\\'t Ken Shamrock.    I used to live close to this area and I would never walk from the airport to that hotel down the 70 outer road late at night. These are the tourists that make the news and we locals think... what the hell were they doing walking down that road in the middle of the night.   I can tell you less about the Metrolink safety except to say the safety is largely based on how many people are on the Metrolink with you.  Given its loufest the Metrolink may be fairly populated. However by the time you get out to the airport almost everyone will have gotten off.   St. Louis is a dangerous city because it\\\'s crime is not contained to one small area. The relatively small population means that major crimes happen all over the place because people can be caught alone. I walk down the streets of Chicago at 3 a.m. and there\\\'s people everywhere, here you can fire a cannon down the streets almost anywhere and not hit anyone.  My suggestion, don\\\'t be the last one to leave LouFest, and cab/uber it from your Metro stop to the hotel.   It may be better to Metro to UMSL or Hanley so you can get Uber instead of the airport and have to take a cab.   Good luck. St louis can be a fun city.  But it can also be very dangerous with the wrong turn.  There doesn\\\'t seem to be much in between, you either love it or hate it.\'[2016-09-09 20:29:53]";
